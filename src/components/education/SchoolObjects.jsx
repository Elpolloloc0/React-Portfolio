  details: "Mentor High was the high school I attended when I lived in the USA. I went through the regular high school curriculum doing all the mandatory courses as well as trying my luck at higher learning areas where possible. I honestly was not the greatest student at this period of time and I took on more than I could handle. During this period I did end up taking a web page design module\ in my final year. The web pages were designed in Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Dreamnweaver so it definitely was a different time then. Thankfully those pages will never see the light of day and my shame will forever be hidden lost to time.",

  course: "BSc Hons. Computer Science with Year in Industry",
  years: "2015-2019: First Class Honors",
  details: "The University of Liverpool is probably the meat and potatoes of my entire software development education. Prior to attending I did not program that much and my background in math's to say the least was shocking. I worked hard to make sure I wasan't left behind in material and learned a large range of languages, technlogies and tools to aid me in my career. Examples like Java, C-family, Swift, PHP and MySQL. In my second year I worked in a group project to create an online store for cards using PHP, MySql and Javascript. A majority of my contribution at that time was with the backend PHP functionality for the overall application. This allowed users to order products, simulate payments and check on the status of shipping as some examples of functionality. I had no previous PHP or scripting language experience so over my easter break I took it upon myself to learn and develop each day. For my final year software project I developed a FPS videogame using Unity3D. All code was programmed in C# utilizing OOP techniques and algorithms I had learned from my university education. I developed player physics, UI, the environment, interactions and enemy AI throughout the year. The AI and the physics was by far the hardest part as I took it upon myself to make my own custom behaviour trees for each one. This game was a very stressful production to say the least but brought out many areas of project management I had not thought of as it was the first big solo project I had ever done. ",
